🧠 Personal Assistant (Team Project)
A console and GUI-based Personal Assistant app built in Python using prompt_toolkit, rich, and customtkinter. The project manages contacts, notes, and to-do lists via a modular architecture and offers both terminal and graphical user interfaces.

📦 Installable via setuptools, with entry points for launching either version.

💡 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of an 8-day sprint simulating a real-world software development workflow. It was designed and implemented by a student team using Agile methodology and professional development tools. Each team member had a defined role, contributing to a realistic collaborative environment.

My role: I actively contributed to the core application logic (main.py) and the modular system (notes.py, address_book.py, etc.). I worked on implementation, feature integration, code cleanup, bugfixes, and improved the command-line user experience.

I also helped debug and integrate the GUI, although I did not write it from scratch.

I prepared the setuptools installer and configured both GUI and CLI entry points for easy launching after installation.
