# ðŸ§  Personal Assistant (Team Project)

A console and GUI-based Personal Assistant app built in Python using [`prompt_toolkit`](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit), [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich), and [`customtkinter`](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).  
The project manages contacts, notes, and to-do lists via a modular architecture and offers both terminal and graphical user interfaces.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

This project was developed during an **8-day Agile sprint** simulating a real-world software development environment. The student team followed professional workflows, including Scrum roles and regular collaboration with a technical mentor.

- **My role**:  
  I chose the Scrum Master role, focusing on communication, organizing meetings, task management, and Trello usage.  
  Additionally, I contributed to core features in `main.py` and helped improve the UX of the CLI version.  
  I also worked on bugfixes after integrating the GUI (`gui.py`), which was written by the Team Lead.  
  In my repository, you can find the reworked `setup.py` configuration and newly created CLI/GUI entry points for convenient launching.
